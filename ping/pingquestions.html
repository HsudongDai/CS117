		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Why did more client output result when you added the loop
to read extra messages after each successful message receipt? Why
were some messages never printed? Why were some printed late and out
of order?</li>
<li class="a">
<ul>
     <li>Most packets can be successfully delivered to the server without meeting any network fluctuation.</li>
     <li>Some packets are dropped by the nasty socket. Since the resending mechanism would try up to 5 times, these packets cannot have a sixth chance.</li>
     <li>The first packet was dropped by the nasty socket but the second wasn't. Hence the response to the 2nd packet would arrive first. The retry mechanism succeeded to resend the '1st' packet, so the response to it arrives at the client later. But finally, both reponses to packets could be printed out.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">What was confusing about this assignment or 
programming framework that we should
explain in more detail before proceeding to the next assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I have plenty of problems about the Makefile. I never used Makefile since either the IDE would accomplish it on background, or I would use CMake to compile a Makefile since it would be a nightmare to deal with thousands of .o or .a or ELF files manually.
</li>


<li class="q">How much UDP (datagram) style programming did you already know before doing this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I used other languages to do some similar jobs, such as JavaScript, Python and Golang. 
</li>
