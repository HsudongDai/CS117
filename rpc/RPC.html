		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission directory?</li>
<li class="a">
In my tests, my program can deal with all the idls provided in the RPC.samples. It can correcltly deal with structs, arrays and arrays of struct.
</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li style="text-decoration:underline;">__X__ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>_____ Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
It is a simple one. We simply encode every function call and return as a string. The string is then sent over TCP. The server then decodes the string and calls the function. The result is then encoded and sent back to the client.<br><br>
To the encoding, the function name is put at the beginning. The for every parameter, no matter what type it is, is encoded as a BASE64 string using a public BASE64 library. Since it is not a library used to serialize or parse data, we turned to GitHub and picked up a high-ranked one for convenience. Each string is separated with a space character and concatenated together.<br><br>
The order of the encoded data is serial, following the appearing order of the parameters or struct members, and the indices of arrays.
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
We discussed the protocol with Rui Yao and Erli Cai. We got inspired by the encoding. We tried to design a 4-byte header for each argument and make the stream self-expressed. They inspired us that we can have a consensus on both sides, so the server can know the mapping between the each byte and argument and the client can output everything into the stream.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
I learned a lot about the binary protocol of RPC. I've read the documents of protobuf and it is highly efficient, but it would be a little too complex for the assignment. <br><br>
Besides, I learned the designing concept of proxies. Using a well-designed unified interface, we can make the system more user-friendly.
</li>
