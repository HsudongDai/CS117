 <div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Describe briefly Tim Berners-Lee's reasons for creating the Web. What influenced him to build it,
in what environment was he working, and what were the short and long term goals he was trying to achieve (a paragraph
or two is fine &#8212; this is just to make sure you are up on the background for Tim's work) </li>
<li class="a">
Tim Berners-Lee was born in a family whose both parents are computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer. His family must have a long and strong influence on his career. <br>

After his graduation from Oxford University with a B.A degree in physics, he worked as a sofware engineer at a telecommunication company. Then he went to CERN as a contractor for 6 months. During this half year, he proposed a project called ENQUIRE based on <i>hypertext</i> and <i>hyperlink</i> to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. He finished the prototype but it was almost immediately forgotten. <br>

After leaving CERN, he ran another company technical's side for 3 years. He accumulated experience on computer networking. Then he returned to CERN as a fellow. This time, he felt that it was high time reconstructing the Internet with <i>hypertext</i>. He proposed his idea, got approved to buy a new NeXT machine, programmed the ENQUIRE system on it. He designed HTML, HTTP and URL, the basic concepts of our modern Internet. Finally, he published the first website on the CERN network and taught others how to use the web browser to access it. He achieved his short-term goal.<br>

After the foundation of World Wide Web Consortium, nowadays his goal is to balance the disparate effects from those big commerical tycoons, refresh the technical standards so that the World Wide Web would always be robust, up-to-date and open to everyone.
</li>

<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least eight technical challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. 
<em>You will not find all the answers set out explicitly in the book. Use your knowledge of computer
systems and your imagination to figure out the sorts of challenges he would have to overcome.</em> Explain each of the eight briefly (one or a few sentences each, unless you care to say more) :</li>
<li class="a">Technical challenges included:
<ol>
<li><b>Reason One: Rare and instable link hardware:</b> At the very beginning of network, the wires are expensive and low-bandwidth. It strictly limits the imagination of potential users. </li>
<li><b>Reason Two: No packet switching protocol</b> Traditional circuit switching protocol would be excessively expensive for a personal contractor.  </li>
<li><b>Reason Three: Old concept to prefer central 'menu' but not hyperlink</b> Modern Internet is an open and decentralized system. Maintaining a central database is expensive and the bottleneck of performance. </li>
<li><b>Reason Four: No standard webpage language protocol</b> HTML was invented by Tim. At that time, SGML was another powerful competitor. However, the tool to view and modify SGML was controlled by a French company so that Tim created the new one also for compatibility. </li>
<li><b>Reason Five: Cross platform</b> ENQUIRE was done on NeXT, while TCP/IP on Unix and VAX/VMS systems. There must be a general, cross-platform protocol to provide access service. </li>
<li><b>Reason Six: Programming Language for web programs</b> The original program was done with Objective-C, however, C was used as the common language for portable programs. He had to program again. </li>
<li><b>Reason Seven: No web content transmission protocol</b> No existed data-transfer protocol could do the format negotiation since it must serve clients from all over the world as a decentralized system. </li>
<li><b>Reason Eight: How to locate the resources online</b> Everything on the Internet must be accessible to all the users. That is, there must be a link directing to it. A URL was designed for this goal. </li>
</ol>

</li>

<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least two organizational, legal and/or economic challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. Explain each briefly:</li>
<li class="a">Organizational, legal or economic challenges included:
<ol>
<li><b>Reason One: Whether this World Wide Web could use GPL</b> The University of Minnesota decided to charge for a license fee from certain classes of users who wanted to use gopher. If CERN refused to publish the WWW for free, no other commercial or  </li>
<li><b>Reason Two: Little support from CERN inside</b> Though Tim published several projects on RPC and hypertext, most different groups gave little help to help him move on. No feedback, no improvement. </li>
</ol>
